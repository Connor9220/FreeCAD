# ADR-003: Safe height and Clearance height in operations

## Status
Legacy / DRAFT

## Context
Each operation is relatively atomic in the context of a job.
The final sequence of job gcode depends on the fixtures selected and the ordering of operations within those fixtures.
Consequently, we need some basic assumptions about where the tool will be located at the beginning and the end of an operation in order to avoid collisions.

## Decision
The operation is responsible for acting on all of the target geometry selected.  For example, a pocket operation may specify multiple
faces to be cleared.  It is the responsibility of the operation to move the cutter into each area, clear it, retract and move to the next.

- Clearance height will be assumed to be safe to move laterally at any time with the loaded tool. 
- Safe height will be assumed to be safe to move laterally within the operation.
- The operation will assume that the cutter is at clearance height at the start of the operation.
- Before acting on any target geometry, the cutter should move at rapid speed  to safe height.
- The operation will end with a G0 <clearance height> to restore the cutter to  clearance in preparation for the next operation.


## Consequences

Advantages
- consistent behavior within and between operations

Disadvantages
- Moves to clearance height between operations may not be as efficient as
  possible. Final refinement should be left to the postprocessor.
