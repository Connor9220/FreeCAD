# ADR-001: Use Dressups to modify base operations

## Status
Legacy

## Context
Operations often share tool path elements.  For example and entry or exit move may be part of pocket, profiling, or engaving operations.
The user is usually thinking about these aspects of the toolpath at a different point than when they are considering the main path.
They may configure the profile operation and refine its settings until they are happy. Then turn their attention to holding tags and entry moves.

We need a way to abstract the path modifications so that the logic can be modular and so the user can apply them naturally.

## Decision
Dressup as a separate conceptual element.  A dressup is applied to an existing toolpath.

## Consequences
- Gains: simpler operation task panels, modular logic
- Costs: users are initially unfamiliar with the concept.  Requires an extra
  step.
