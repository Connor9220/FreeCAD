# üìç FreeCAD CAM Workbench Roadmap ‚Äì 2025 and Beyond

This document aims to guide the ongoing development of the CAM Workbench. It sets out shared goals, identifies pain points and opportunities, and invites discussion, collaboration, and contributions from the wider community.

FreeCAD is a volunteer-driven project. This roadmap does not prescribe work or enforce deadlines ‚Äî it is a living document to help focus effort and encourage alignment across developers, users, and stakeholders.

# üî≠ Vision
*(this section establishes non-negotiable big-picture definition of what we are buildin)*

A robust, intuitive, and industry-ready CAM solution that:

- Integrates seamlessly with the FreeCAD modeling workflow, unit schemas, and translation
- Supports professional CNC workflows
- Is usable and intuitive for hobbyist and non-professionals
- Embraces open standards
- Encourages extensibility and script-ability via Python

## ‚öôÔ∏è Functionality
*(this section describes expected functionality in agnostic terms.  No FreeCAD-specific language)*

Any CAM application meeting the needs above must provide functionality in these areas:
- [Tool Management](<./Functionality/Tool Management.md>)
- [Stock and Work-piece Setup](<./Functionality/Stock and Work-piece Setup.md>)
- [Job Management](<./Functionality/Job Management.md>)
- [Operation Configuration](<./Functionality/Operation Configuration.md>)
- [Simulation and Verification](<./Functionality/Simulation and Verification.md>)
- [Output Generation](<./Functionality/Output Generation.md>)
- [Scripting and automation](<./Functionality/Scripting and automation.md>)

## üßº Code Overview
*(this section provides a starting point for developers to understand how CAM is organized.)*
*( It also gives an honest assessment of the code quality and areas of improvement with an eye toward good coding practices)*

Additionally, as software developers we desire the source code to excel in these areas:
- Modular
- DRY
- Extensible
- Testable

### ADR Log
| ADR                           | Description                            |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| [ADR-001](<./ADR/ADR-001.md>) | Use Dressups to modify base operations |
| [ADR-002](<./ADR/ADR-002.md>) | Internal representation of tool path   |
|                               |                                        |


# üìä Current State
*(This section is a report card.  As much as possible, the scoring will be automated though subjective considerations will occur)*

- **Completeness**:  Degree to which all desired functionality is implemented.
- **Correctness**: Degree to which the implemented functionality meets user expectations
- **Performant**: Degree to which the functionality performs as designed fast and without errors
- **Maintainable**: Degree to which the functionality is well implemented in source code

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Pain Points
*(this section functions like an FAQ.  It helps keep users from creating duplicate issues.  It gives new developers a first place to connect)*

Perennial complaints from users:

- Visualization of first rapid move in operation makes it appear as though tool
  returns to origin between ops (It doesn't)
- Climb vs Conventional terminology not consistently used
- Safe Height vs Clearance Height confusing
- Arrays of similar gcode
- Lack of F & S calculation

# üî• Short-Term Goals (1-3 months)
| Work Unit | Why it should be a priority | Submitter |
| -------| -----------------------------| -----------|
| Linking generator | abstracting the generation of linking moves to a generator would allow us to factor this logic out of the individual operations.  The ops would get more consistent and easier to maintain. It will allow us to build a more intuitive drilling operation.| sliptonic| 
| Adaptive generator| factoring out the adaptive algorithm to a generator would allow us to move the adaptive operation into pocket and 3D pocket as a strategy.| sliptonic| 
| split sanity tests and report generation| Current the sanity command runs the tests and generates the setup page output.  Splitting them would allow us to run the tests without generating the output.  The tests could be run indepedently to flag common problems for users| sliptonic|


# üß± Mid-Term Goals (3-12 months)
*(Mid term goals are probably 2+ feature releases in the future)*


# üöÄ Long-Term Goals
*(this section will be a list of links to large issues, FreeCAD Enhancement Proposals (FEP) or github discussions. Pre-development planning)*

    - Support for 5-axis milling
    - STEP-NC support
    - OMI
