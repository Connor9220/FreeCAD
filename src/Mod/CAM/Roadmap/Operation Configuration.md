# [topic name placeholder]

Operations represent the core of the CAM workbench.  They hold most of the complexity and a majority of the actual source code.  To manage this code and complexity, the operation logic is broken into several logical parts.  The implementation of this abstraction is inconsistent.

Notes:
- The three big groups, CircularHoleBase, EngraveBase, and PocketBase can be thought of as working on points, wires, and planar faces respectively.  (In actuality, CircularHolebase works on an edge aligned with the spindle)
- Area is the oddball. It is a legacy abstraction and could be refactored out.
- Surface and Waterline are both OCL-based operations and work on faces, including curved faces.  They should be refactored to inherit from a common SurfaceBase
- Adaptive should be refactored as a strategy of pocket.
- Slot has extensive logic to calculate the appropriate wire but otherwise
  works on a wire.  It could be refactored to inherit from EngraveBase

## GUI
The user facing logic when running the FreeCAD GUI.  The GUI is responsible for managing the state of the taskpanels and responding to user actions.
All other logic should reside in the operation.  It also contains the ViewProvider of the operation which renders the Path Commands in the scenegraph.

### Command
User-facing functionality is triggered by a GUI command that is registered when the workbench is activated.  The commands should be 

### Task Panel
The task panel is the primary place where a user interacts with the operation.
Task panels should be carefully designed and reviewed with DWG.
Not all operation properties need to be exposed through task panels.  It is perfectly acceptable to keep seldom-used or advanced feature properties only accessible through the property pane.
This has the benefit of keeping the task panels clean and efficient while providing advanced users a what to fine tune operations.


## Operation
The operation is responsible for managing the state (properties) of the operation and calculating the Path Commands. Specifically,
it 

- manages the targets (geometry to be acted upon). Determines the order to act
  on them.
- Calculates the linking moves to position the cutter in each target
- Computes the cutting moves to act on the target (using generators, helpers,
  libraries)
- Moves the cutter to an appropriate location at the end of the last cutting
  move.


## Generator

Generators are low-level functions that compute the cutting moves for a single target.
They have no user interface and are implemented as pure functions.  
Generators should have 100% test coverage at all times because they may be called from multiple operation contexts.

For example, creating a helical move may be done
- By the helix operation
- As an entry move to a pocketing operation

### Current Generators
- Drill Generator (Generates canned cycle drilling commands)
- Helix
- Rotation
- Tapping
- threadmilling
- toolchange
- dogboneII

### Needed Generators
- Pocket (zigzag)
- Pocket (adaptive)
- Pocket (offset)
- Line
- Linking
- vcarve
